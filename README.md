The Bioinformatics Hub is a place where bioinformaticians gather together with three aims:

(i) to provide their advice, knowledge, and support to anyone with a relevant question;
(ii) to discuss current issues and challenges in proteomics informatics with the entire community; and
(iii) to work on interesting, synergistic projects and to freely exchange tools, algorithms, and know-how with each other, across all labs, seniorities, and levels of experience.
