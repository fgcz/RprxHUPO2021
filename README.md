Note from Eric:

As I mentioned in previous emails, the goal is to foster discussion rather than just presentation. Your tutorials idea is fine, but weaving in some opportunities for discussion would be highly appreciated, rather than a passive session. Perhaps facilitate some discussion about needs and future directions.
