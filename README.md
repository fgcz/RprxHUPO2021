https://hupo2021.org/bioinformatics-hub/

The Bioinformatics Hub is a place where bioinformaticians gather together with three aims:

(i) to provide their advice, knowledge, and support to anyone with a relevant question;
(ii) to discuss current issues and challenges in proteomics informatics with the entire community; and
(iii) to work on interesting, synergistic projects and to freely exchange tools, algorithms, and know-how with each other, across all labs, seniorities, and levels of experience.

Note from Eric by email:

As I mentioned in previous emails, the goal is to foster discussion rather than just presentation. Your tutorials idea is fine, but weaving in some opportunities for discussion would be highly appreciated, rather than a passive session. Perhaps facilitate some discussion about needs and future directions.
